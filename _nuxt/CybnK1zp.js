I am Reid Merrell, a computer science undergrad at Brigham Young University. Technology has always been fascinating to me, and I entered my college career with a desire to learn more about it. Shortly into my college career, I discovered my love for software development and algorithm design and eagerly pursued computer science for its emphasis in mathematics and programming. After a few bumps along the way, I am now a short few months away from graduating with my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science. I am excited to enter the industry, and look forward to the opportunities that await me! </p><p> Outside of school, you can find me and my wife exploring Provo, hiking in the mountains, or binge watching our favorite series. I am also working with a group of friends to develop a top-down role-playing game, which has been an incredibly challenging, yet exciting, project. Otherwise, you can catch me preparing storylines and plots for a novel I am writing or for table-top role-playing games. </p></div><div class="pfp-card"><h3>Reid Merrell</h3><p>Computer Science Student at BYU</p><p>AI and Graphics Enthusiast</p></div></div><footer><hr><p> Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reid-merrell-ai-graphics-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></p><p>Powered by <a href="https://nuxt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuxt</a></p><p>Reid Merrell 2025</p></footer>',2))],64)}}};export{h as default};
