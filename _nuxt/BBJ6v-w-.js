I am Reid Merrell, a computer science undergrad at Brigham Young University. Technology has always been fascinating to me, and I entered my college career with a desire to learn more about it. Shortly into my college career, I discovered my love for software development and algorithm design and eagerly pursued computer science for its emphasis in mathematics and programming. After a few bumps along the way, I am now a short few months away from graduating with my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science. I am excited to enter the industry, and look forward to the opportunities that await me! </p><p> Outside of school, you can find me and my wife exploring Provo, hiking in the mountains, or binge watching our favorite series. I am also dipping my toes into game-dev with a group of friends to create a top-down, role-playing game. </p></div><div class="pfp-card"><h3>Reid Merrell</h3><p>Computer Science Student at BYU</p><p>AI and Graphics Enthusiast</p></div></div>',4)),e("div",w,[e("div",k,[t[0]||(t[0]=e("div",{class:"center-container"},[e("div",null,[e("h2",null,"Explore"),e("p",null," Dive into my projects in full stack development, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics!
