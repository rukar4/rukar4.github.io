I am Reid Merrell, a computer science undergrad at Brigham Young University. Technology has always been fascinating to me, and I entered my college career with a desire to learn more about it. Shortly into my college career, I discovered my love for software development and algorithm design and eagerly pursued computer science for its emphasis in mathematics and programming. After a few bumps along the way, I am now a short few months away from graduating with my Bachelor&#39;s degree in Computer Science. I am excited to enter the industry, and look forward to the opportunities that await me! </p><p> Outside of school, you can find me and my wife exploring Provo, hiking in the mountains, or binge watching our favorite series. I am also dipping my toes into game-dev with a group of friends to create a top-down, role-playing game. </p></div><div class="media pfp-card"><div class="media-clip"><img src="'+p+'" alt="Reid Merrell"></div></div></div><hr><h2 class="center-container"> Explore My Projects </h2>',6)),(r(),i(o,null,v(s,(e,m)=>t(n,{key:e.title,title:e.title,date:e.date,description:e.description,highlights:e.highlights,stack:e.stack,image:e.image,video:e.video,"media-note":e.mediaNote,github:e.github,demo:e.demo,flipped:m%2===1},null,8,["title","date","description","highlights","stack","image","video","media-note","github","demo","flipped"])),64)),t(l),t(d)],64)}}};export{C as default};
